/**
 * Task 10669bdd — single source of truth for the auth token (stale-token fix).
 *
 * THE BUG:
 *   hooks/useAuth.ts used to pin a STATIC token/headers onto the global OpenAPI
 *   config (`OpenAPI.TOKEN = '<captured string>'`,
 *   `OpenAPI.HEADERS = { Authorization: 'Bearer <captured string>' }`) at
 *   module-load and on every login. That static value raced with — and could
 *   clobber — api/client.ts's FUNCTION resolver that reads localStorage fresh.
 *   After a stale token was captured, some parallel authed calls sent the STALE
 *   token (→ 401) while siblings sent the fresh one. A single such 401 then
 *   tripped the force-logout → logout loop.
 *
 * THE FIX:
 *   localStorage 'aidis_token' is the ONLY source of truth. api/client.ts's
 *   OpenAPI.TOKEN is a function that reads it fresh on every request, and
 *   useAuth.ts only writes localStorage (it no longer pins a static copy).
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES:
 *   - OpenAPI.TOKEN is a FUNCTION (not a pinned string).
 *   - It always resolves to whatever is CURRENTLY in localStorage — including
 *     across a "stale token present, then fresh login replaces it" sequence —
 *     so it is impossible for one call to carry a stale token while a sibling
 *     carries the fresh one.
