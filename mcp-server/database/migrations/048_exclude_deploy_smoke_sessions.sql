-- Migration: Exclude deploy-smoke sessions from session analytics
-- Date: 2026-06-20
-- Task: bc819ae5 (deploy-smoke leaves litter sessions)
-- Purpose:
--   The fleet deploy smoke (scripts/fleet-deploy.sh) POSTs /api/v2/sessions/start
--   to every instance on every deploy to prove the session write-path is alive.
--   That created a real, untitled, never-ended `sessions` row PER INSTANCE PER
--   DEPLOY — litter that polluted the sessions list and the session stats fleet-wide.
--
--   The smoke now MARKS those sessions with agent_type = 'deploy-smoke' (and ends
--   them immediately as best-effort cleanup). This migration is the DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
--   half of the fix: it EXCLUDES any session marked 'deploy-smoke' from the
--   analytics surface at the view layer, so even if a smoke session is NOT cleaned
--   up (cleanup is best-effort / can fail on a flaky deploy), it can never count.
--
--   This guards the whole CLASS at the read boundary (Lesson 011): v_session_summaries
--   feeds the sessions list, single-session detail, and the compare endpoint. The
--   stats query (SessionStatsService.getSessionStatsEnhanced) reads `FROM sessions`
--   directly and is guarded in code with the SAME predicate — the two read paths
--   share one marker, DEPLOY_SMOKE_AGENT_TYPE = 'deploy-smoke'.
--
--   IS DISTINCT FROM (not !=) so a NULL agent_type row is KEPT (NULL = 'x' is NULL,
--   which would wrongly drop legitimate legacy rows whose agent_type is null).

BEGIN;

-- DROP then CREATE (not CREATE OR REPLACE): CREATE OR REPLACE cannot change a
-- column's data type, and the baseline declares productivity_score as
-- numeric(5,2) while this view (like migration 031) stubs it as plain numeric —
-- so a replace fails with 42P16 "cannot change data type of view column".
-- A clean DROP + CREATE sidesteps that. No dependent objects rely on this view.
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_session_summaries;

-- Recreate v_session_summaries (identical to 031 + the deploy-smoke exclusion).
