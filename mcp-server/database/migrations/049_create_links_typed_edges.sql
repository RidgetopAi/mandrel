-- Migration 049: TYPED-EDGE GRAPH — the `links` table (Mandrel Core Redesign T2a).
--
-- WHY (spec §4 Capability 1, task 8a296229): replace string-tag threading
-- (unrepairable, typo-fragile, ANY-overlap) with a REAL, bidirectional, repairable
-- edge store. Tags can't enforce referential integrity, can't reverse-lookup, can't be
-- repaired — edges can. This is the structural foundation the moat (T2b trust +
-- T3 recall_thread) is built on. Tags STAY (demoted to the human-viewable lens/label
-- path: scope:/owner:/ref:); edges carry STRUCTURE.
--
-- WHAT: a single additive `links` table. Each row is a typed, directed edge
-- from_id → to_id, scoped to a project, deduped by UNIQUE(from_id, to_id, edge_type),
-- with both-direction traversal indexes.
--
-- EDGE-TYPE DOMAIN — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the CHECK below MUST match
-- mcp-server/src/config/edgeTypes.ts (EDGE_TYPES). That module is the canonical domain;
-- the zod validation derives from it, and a contract test (typedEdges.contract.test.ts)
-- asserts this DB CHECK and the config agree, so they cannot drift. No magic strings:
-- the list here is the materialized projection of that named config.
--
-- ADDITIVE / IDEMPOTENT / BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE:
--   * CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS + CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS — safe to re-run.
--   * Adds a brand-new table; nothing existing is altered or dropped.
--   * No data migration here (existing edges are backfilled by the separate idempotent
--     backfill script, run by Ridge after deploy — never folded into this migration).
--
-- This migration number (049) is ABOVE BASELINE_THROUGH (42), so it runs normally on
-- BOTH fresh builds (after the 000 baseline) and existing/already-baselined instances.
-- The schema-contract reference (scripts/schema-reference.sql.txt) is regenerated to
-- include this table so the CI drift gate (ci.sh stage 0c) stays GREEN and honest.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS links (
  id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  -- Endpoints span three tables (contexts/decisions/tasks); we store the id + its kind
  -- rather than a polymorphic FK (Postgres can't FK to a union of tables). The kind
  -- columns are CHECK-constrained to the resolvable entity set so a typo can't store a
  -- nonsense endpoint type.

              )),
  -- Project scope: edges are project-scoped so traversal/trust stays within a tenant.
  -- Nullable for robustness (an edge whose endpoints predate project scoping), but
  -- normally set to the minting record's project.
  project_id  UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  -- Provenance: 'auto:context_store' / 'auto:decision_record' / 'link' (explicit) /

  metadata    JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  -- DEDUPE: the same directed typed edge is stored once. The backfill + auto-mint paths
  -- rely on this (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING) for idempotency.
  CONSTRAINT links_from_to_edge_uniq UNIQUE (from_id, to_id, edge_type)
);

-- BOTH-DIRECTION TRAVERSAL: index (from_id, edge_type) for forward walks and
-- (to_id, edge_type) for reverse walks, so get_links / recall_thread can fetch a
-- record's edges in either direction without a sequential scan.

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_links_to   ON links (to_id, edge_type);
