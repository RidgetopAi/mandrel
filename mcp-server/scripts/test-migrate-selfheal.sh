# test-migrate-selfheal.sh — automated proof harness for migrate.ts self-heal
# =============================================================================
# Proves the non-fresh self-heal in scripts/migrate.ts on DISPOSABLE postgres
# databases (created + dropped here; never touches mandrel/mandrel-* or real data).
#
# Scenarios:
#   1. Self-heal fires  — pre-baseline existing DB (old-lineage _aidis_migrations
#      rows, baseline schema installed, 000 NOT stamped) → no throw, auto-stamps
#      000 + <=42, ends 0 pending; second run = clean no-op (idempotent).
#   2. Fresh           — empty DB (no _aidis_migrations) → baseline installs + stamps.
#   3. Already-baselined — 000 + <=42 already stamped → self-heal no-op, up to date.
#   4. Blank non-fresh guard — _aidis_migrations exists but NO core tables →
#      self-heal does NOT fire (won't hide a real missing-schema situation).
#
# Runs the REAL `tsx scripts/migrate.ts` as a subprocess per scenario with a
# per-scenario DATABASE_NAME. Drops every temp DB on exit (even on failure).
