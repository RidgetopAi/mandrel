    // against ONE shared CI Postgres (scripts/ci.sh provisions a single disposable
    // ci_* DB), and several integration tests boot a real server on a FIXED port.
    // Running test FILES in parallel forks therefore causes cross-file contention:
    // two files mutate/read the same tables in an overlapping window (order-dependent
    // flake — Inspector hit it on the decision tests) and two server-boot files race
    // for the same port. Pin file execution to a SINGLE fork so files run one-at-a-time,
    // making the suite ORDER-INDEPENDENT and contention-free. `it`/`test` cases within a
    // file still run normally; only cross-FILE parallelism is removed. Runtime cost is
    // small (the suite is I/O-bound on the shared DB anyway, which serialized contention
    // was already throttling).
